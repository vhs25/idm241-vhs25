    <h1>Victoria Stauffer's Alpha Assignment</h1>
    <h2>Website:</h2>
    <p>Before you click! - The animation of my chosen microinteraction only happens when the page is laded the first time. For me, once I've open the site in a browser and reload, it does not spin again.</p>
    <p>Look in the top, left corner at the orange *star* !</p>

    <h3>Triggers:</h3>
    <p>Thee trigger for this microinteraction is on load. When the page is loaded the very first time, either when you click its link or type its url.</p>
    <h4>Rules:</h4>
    <p>After the page is loaded, the astrix/star shape in the header spins for around 2-3 seconds. That's all. It's very simple, but I was surprisingly delighted the first time I saw it. It added a sort of fun "welcome to thee page!"</p>
    <h5>Loops & Modes</h5>
    <p>The only thing that changes is the trigger conditions. This animation only shows on the first page load. Once a user has visited the page once, when they reload it or open it in another tab, it doesn't play for a while. </p>
