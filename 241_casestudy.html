    <h1>Microinteractions</h1>
    <p>The following microinteractions were built as part of a term-long class that investigated different types of microinteractions that exist in technology. I built two - one simple and one comlex, each meant to enhance my <a href="http://vstauffer.net/idm232/final/" target="_blank">recipe website.</a></p>

    <div class="orange">
    <h2 class="h">The Challenge</h2>
    <p>Each microinteraction I created required a clear trigger, rules and feedback, as well as loops or modes (changing conditions) in the more complex.</p>
    <p>You can view the code for this project on my <b><a href="https://github.com/vhs25/idm241-vhs25" target="_blank" id="dark">Github.</a></b></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 class="h">The Flower</h3>
        <div id="flex">
        <img src="tiny_flower.png" alt="small yellow flower" id="spin">
        <img src="starspin.gif" alt="Gif of * spin animation" id="gif"><br>
        </div>
        <p>My first microinteraction was a simple one inspired by this <a href="https://css-tricks.com" target="_blank">spinning star</a> (seen above) on the css-tricks webste. I thought the anmation was fun and wanted to use it to enhance my <a href="http://vstauffer.net/idm232/final/recipe.php?id=1" target="_blank">home button.</a> I took abut two days to plan and build this microinteraction. I found some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14859322/css3-spin-animation" target="_href">example code</a> that I was able to tweak and built this using CSS code.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="orange">
        <h4 class="h">The Flower's Triggers</h4>
        <p>This microinteraction is triggered when the user hovers over the image.</p>
        <h5 class="h">Rules & Feedback</h5>
        <p>When triggered, the flower spins fairly quickly. It continues to spin until the user moves their mouse away, or clicks and is taken to a different page.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h6 class="h">The Menu Dropdown</h6>
        <img src="dropdown2.gif" alt="gif of the dropdownsequence" id="dropdown">
        <p>This microinteraction is more complex. I had this idea as a way to make moving between a recipe's instructions and ingredients easy, without having to scroll a lot on your mobile device. I spent about three weeks planning and building this in javascript.<br>
        <a href="http://vstauffer.net/idm241/final/final_build.html" target="_blank" id="ddlink">Try it on your phone, or a small window!</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="orange">
        <h4 class="h">Triggers</h4>
        <p>The triggers for this microinteraction are scroll and tap/click.</p>
        <h5 class="h">Rules & Feedback</h5>
        <p>When the user scrolls, a dropdown bar sticks to the top of the page. When clicked, it reopens and closes the ingredients box. Then if you scroll back up, it becomes a full-sized part of the page again.</p>
        <h5 class="h">Loops & Modes</h5>
        <p>The change of conditions in this microinteraction happen on scroll. When you scroll down, the ingredients square becomes a dropdown menu triggered by a tap. Then it returns to normal when you scroll back up.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4 class="h">That's all!</h4>
        <p>Overall, I am pleased with my microinteractions. They each are of varying complexity and, I feel, enhance the experience of my recipe site. This class and has taught me the value of taking that extra step in your design, as well as how to find resources to help you build it. As a designer and developer, I will use these skills to continue thinking outside of the box as I design future websites. </p>
